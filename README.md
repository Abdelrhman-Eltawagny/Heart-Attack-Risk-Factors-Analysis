# (Heart Attack Dataset)
## Dataset

The heart attack data consists of information regarding 1024 patient, including
chest pain type , Blood pressure ,cholesterol and other features. The dataset can be found on the
kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset),
with feature documentation available on the same site.



## Summary of Findings

In exploration, I found that the type of chest pain may be the cause of a heart attack
It also found that men are more likely to have a heart attack, because they have high blood pressure levels, and because men who have diabetes are more than the number of women. During my exploration, I also found that young people are the highest category in heart rate and that they have a high rate of blood pressure.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, first I explored the distribution of both blood pressure and cholesterol in the blood, and then I focused on the most important factors that could affect the occurrence of a heart attack. The factors are blood pressure, blood sugar level and heart rate for both women and Men.I counted the number of men and women who have high pressure (i.e. higher than 130) and then used a swarmplot to display the result. After that, I also calculated the number of men and women, whether they suffer from diabetes or not, and I used a stacked plot to display my results. In the end I used a boxplot to see the heart rates of both women and men.
